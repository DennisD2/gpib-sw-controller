Things to do
------------
- Bring device-finding to live. I hoped that addressing each device in a serial poll and reading
 in status byte will fail for non-existant devices. See gpib_find_devices(). But for unknown reason,
 gpib_read never gives an error. Hm.
- Alphabetically sort (?) help lines.
- include code from community



Things done
-----------
- code + command to enable/disable SRQs
